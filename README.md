# intents

Very simple start of an offers and needs app for Holochain.

Copy-pasted from holoworld.

## To install and run:

* [Install Holochain](https://developer.holochain.org/Install_Holochain) if you don't have it installed already.
* Clone this repo to your dev computer.
* In the intents directory, do:
```
hcdev web
```
* Open a browser to http://localhost:4141

Roadmap:

* Add structure to intents: type (offer, need, etc), category, optional resource classification, quantity and unit, description, some dates).
* Add searches.
* Add methods of matching of offers and needs.
* Add [Conversation for Action](https://www.valueflo.ws/introduction/cfa.html) = coming to agreements on exchanges around offers and needs.
