# intents

Very simple start of an offers and needs app for Holochain.

Copy-pastaed from holoworld.

Roadmap:

* Add instructions for installing and running.
* Add structure to intents: type (offer, need, etc), category, optional resource classification, quantity and unit, description, some dates).
* Add searches.
* Add methods of matching of offers and needs.
* Add [Conversation for Action](https://www.valueflo.ws/introduction/cfa.html) = coming to agreements on exchanges around offers and needs.
